An executable patcher for Nioh2

This patch was conceived to fix/stabilise Nioh 2 Enemy Randomiser https://www.nexusmods.com/nioh2/mods/321 The latter causes the game to run out of memory and crash when too many entities are loaded in.

Required files for compiling: https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless

Place in same folder as nioh2.exe and run

Steamless is automatically applied to nioh2.exe followed by binary patching to increase its RAM allocation by roughly 1 GB
