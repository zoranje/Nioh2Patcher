An executable patcher for Nioh2

This patch was conceived to fix/stabilise the performance of Nioh 2 Enemy Randomiser https://www.nexusmods.com/nioh2/mods/321. When we attempt to load in too many entities, the game tends to run of of resources and crash.

Required files for compiling: https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless

Place in same folder as nioh2.exe and run

Steamless is automatically applied to nioh2.exe followed by binary patching to increase its memory allocation by roughly 1 GB
